### Add'l Info
I don't own nor pretend to claim any rights to nyan cat nor the likeness of nyan cat. 
I just think nyan cat is cool, and is a decent standin until I can make a proper icon.
I don't intend to profit off of nyan cat's likeness in any shape or form.
Here is the trademark information for nyan cat: https://trademarks.justia.com/853/57/nyan-85357643.html
